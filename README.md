## Hi there 👋

I'm a Full Stack Developer and Linux SysAdmin who enjoys automating everything (sometimes even thinking... still working on that one 🤖).  

- 🔭 I’m currently working on:  
  A remote server admin panel with SSH, user/group management, hardening tools, and zero patience for manual tasks.  

- 🌱 I’m currently learning:  
  More about containerization (Docker & friends), hardening strategies, and how to not rewrite the same Bash script 12 times.  

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on:  
  Security-focused web tools, automation projects, or anything that replaces a human with a well-behaved cronjob.  

- 🤔 I’m looking for help with:  
  Finding the perfect balance between clean code and “it works, ship it.”  

- 💬 Ask me about:  
  SSH remote management, scripting, Linux, web dev with PHP/JS, security best practices... or why `rm -rf /` is a bad idea.  

- 📫 How to reach me:  
  [LinkedIn](), [Email](), or just `ping` me — literally.  

- 😄 Pronouns:  
  `he/him` but my scripts go by `they/them`.  

- ⚡ Fun fact:  
  I've accidentally hardened my system so much that even *I* couldn’t log in. 10/10 would sudo-lock myself out again.
